READ ME 

This is a very short demo of a game I am working on 
You will NEED 
Python (preferibly 3)
If you dont want to use an ide then you will need some file path skills although an ide makes life easier. 


(UPDATE) If you are using windows(I dont know about linux or macos) just double click the file and click  open with python NOT PYTHON IDE


Also thanks for the support
